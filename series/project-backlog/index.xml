      <description>Over the last several years of my life, I have spent a lot of time doing things and not nearly enough time talking about them. This rendered my previous personal website with very little content and leaves the personal projects I&amp;rsquo;ve invested well too much time on unknown to the world.
Beyond simply sharing my work, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a more formalized and public retrospective where I take time to think about the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.</description>
