Over the last several years of my life, I have spent a lot of time doing things and not nearly enough time talking
about them. This rendered my previous personal website with very little content and leaves the personal
projects I've invested well too much time on unknown to the world.

Beyond simply sharing my work, I'm interested in a more formalized and public retrospective where I take time to think
about the lessons I've learned. After most every personal project is complete, I realize that I had spent way too much
time, money, and effort on a project that delivers no real value to anyone. But I deeply enjoy the process and I 
most certainly learn new skills along the way. At the very least, I have a firm understanding about how much time,
money, and effort such a project will cost in the future :D.

Given that I enjoy the process of personal projects, yet often feel unsatisfied about the end result, I have to
question what I can do to optimize the personal projects I take on to maximize the enjoyment aspect and greatly
reduce the dissatisfaction of the end product. Were the personal projects I took on too ambitious? Would have I enjoyed
them more if I didn't write tests or commit the project to source control? What if I only worked on projects small
enough to complete in a weekend?

The purpose of this weblog is to share my work in a meaningful way while attempting to answer these questions. This may
end up just like every other project in that I will spend well to much effort documenting all of the work I have done
and feel that the effort wasn't worth it in the end. But at the very least, I will have a nicely formatted log of
every project I have worked on that I can spam my friends with :D.

I will start by back filling old projects I have worked on until I get to the present. The older projects have an
unfair advantage in that I have had significantly more time to analyze them and apply learnings towards future
projects. By the time I am done, I may determine that I do not enjoy documenting all of my work, and that will be a
great lesson in and of itself.
