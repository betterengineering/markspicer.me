![me](/images/about/me.jpg "Mark Spicer's profile picture")

Hi, I'm Mark. I'm a New York City based Software Engineer currently working at
[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/). I work on the core, monolithic, CMS platform contributing backend
software, building frameworks and platforms to build product features on top of, and operating the multitude of
binaries running in production.

I spend my free time working at [theprepared.org](https://theprepared.org/)'s workshop/makerspace/coworking community
in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn building hardware projects and learning about manufacturing. Here is a picture of my workbench
(something I'm oddly proud of):
