      <p>Over the last several years of my life, I have spent a lot of time doing things and not nearly enough time talking
about them. This rendered my previous personal website with very little content and leaves the personal
projects I&rsquo;ve invested well too much time on unknown to the world.</p>

<p>Beyond simply sharing my work, I&rsquo;m interested in a more formalized and public retrospective where I take time to think
about the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned. After most every personal project is complete, I realize that I had spent way too much
time, money, and effort on a project that delivers no real value to anyone. But I deeply enjoy the process and I
most certainly learn new skills along the way. At the very least, I have a firm understanding about how much time,
money, and effort such a project will cost in the future :D.</p>

<p>Given that I enjoy the process of personal projects, yet often feel unsatisfied about the end result, I have to
question what I can do to optimize the personal projects I take on to maximize the enjoyment aspect and greatly
reduce the dissatisfaction of the end product. Were the personal projects I took on too ambitious? Would have I enjoyed
them more if I didn&rsquo;t write tests or commit the project to source control? What if I only worked on projects small
enough to complete in a weekend?</p>

<p>The purpose of this weblog is to share my work in a meaningful way while attempting to answer these questions. This may
end up just like every other project in that I will spend well to much effort documenting all of the work I have done
and feel that the effort wasn&rsquo;t worth it in the end. But at the very least, I will have a nicely formatted log of
every project I have worked on that I can spam my friends with :D.</p>

<p>I will start by back filling old projects I have worked on until I get to the present. The older projects have an
unfair advantage in that I have had significantly more time to analyze them and apply learnings towards future
projects. By the time I am done, I may determine that I do not enjoy documenting all of my work, and that will be a
great lesson in and of itself.</p>
